# Comradearo
Comradearo is an application implemented in C++ using various data structures like graphs, linked lists, stacks and queues to implement a looklike of a social media network.

# About
Comradearo, as the word "Comrade" suggests is a friend or someone who shares their interests with others. Since we have implemented a social media network where users can post, send friend requests and interact with various people across the globe, we chose this name.
The main purpose of this project is to understand the usage of data structures and hence, no database has been used.
